# SQL-QuickSetup

**SQL-QuickSetup** is a Windows automation tool designed to quickly and easily configure Microsoft SQL Server for access over a Local Area Network (LAN) and the Internet (WAN). It aims to simplify the SQL Server configuration process, especially for developers, small offices, or test environments.

The application runs with administrative privileges to manage all necessary technical settings (TCP/IP activation, Windows Firewall rule creation, user management) from a single, user-friendly interface.

## üö® Important Security Warning

Exposing a database server directly to the Internet carries **significant security risks**. When using this tool, please ensure you take the following precautions:
*   **Use Strong Passwords:** Create complex, hard-to-guess passwords for the SQL user.
*   **Port Forwarding:** You **must** configure port forwarding on your modem/router for Internet access. The tool cannot do this for you but will guide you on how to do it.
*   **Dynamic IP and DDNS:** Most home internet connections use a dynamic IP. For a stable, uninterrupted connection, it is highly recommended to use a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service like `No-IP`.
